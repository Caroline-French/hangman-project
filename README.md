# Hangman Project

## Introduction

This is a project assignment from  the AICore skills bootcamp, in which I am putting into practice what I've learned so far about programming using Python.

## How to play the game
This is the classic Hangman game, in which the computer will select a secret word for you to guess.  The computer will prompt you to guess a letter, and tell you if the letter you guessed is in the word or not.  If the letter isn't in the word, you lose a life.  You start the game with 5 lives, and if you lose all 5 words before you correctly guess the word you lose.  When you correctly guess all the letters in the word before losing all your lives, you win!

## Installation instructions
The code to run the full game is in the file milestone_5.py.  Please run this Python file using your usual method of running Python files. 

## Usage instructions
After running the file milestone_5.py, you will be asked to guess a letter.  Continue following the on-screen instructions until the game is complete.
