# Hangman Project

## Introduction

This is a project assignment from  the AICore skills bootcamp, in which I am putting into practice what I've learned so far about programming using Python.  It is a version of the classic Hangman game, in which the computer selects a secret word and the user tries to identify the word by guessing letters in the word.

This project has given me the opportunity to learn how to apply the following knowledge and skills learned on the bootcamp to a real-life project, including:

- Using VS Code
- Using the command line in GitBash
- Using Git and GitHub version control
- Working with Conda environments
- Object Oriented Programming
- Control flow
- Functions
- Comprehensions
- Docstrings

Through applying what I've learned in the course to this project I have gained a more in-depth understanding of how to effectively use this knowledge and skills, and how to troubleshoot problems.

## How to play the game
This is the classic Hangman game, in which the computer will select a secret word for you to guess.  The computer will prompt you to guess a letter, and tell you if the letter you guessed is in the word or not.  If the letter isn't in the word, you lose a life.  You start the game with 5 lives, and if you lose all 5 words before you correctly guess the word you lose.  When you correctly guess all the letters in the word before losing all your lives, you win!

## Installation instructions
The code to run the full game is in the file milestone_5.py.  Please run this Python file using your usual method of running Python files. 

## Usage instructions
After running the file milestone_5.py, you will be asked to guess a letter.  Continue following the on-screen instructions until the game is complete.
The list of words included in the file is a list of fruits.  If you would like to use a different word list you can substitute your own word list to call the play_game function in line 95!.
